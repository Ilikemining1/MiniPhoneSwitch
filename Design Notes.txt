Electronic Controlled Electromechanical Switch:
	Trunks:
		2 POTS trunk lines
		DID support if possible, would need to parse Caller ID
		If not, programmable extension ringing
	Stations:
		8 Analog stations, each with programmable DNs.  
		DTMF and Pulse Support
		Properish full ring voltage, 90v RMS 20Hz Sine
	Tone Banks:
		2 tone banks, need at least one for each internal voice bus
		Produce call progress tones and decode DTMF
		Separate tone buses
	Internal Buses:
		2 internal voice paths, allowing for two simulaneous calls with any number of stations attached (multi-way calling)
		Can be used for internal calls or connected to a free analog trunk to place an outgoing call
		2 tone buses individually selectable.

		Microcontroller:
			Pin requirements:
				Trunks:
					2 Ring Sense (Input)
					4 Trunk Routing (Output)
				Stations:
					8 Ring Enable (Output)
					16 Hook Detect / Dial Pulse (Input)
					32 Call Routing (Output)
				Tone Banks:
					8 DTMF Decoder Sense (Input)
					Currently TBD Output for Tone Generation, probably I2C (Output)
				
				Total: 26 Inputs, 44 Outputs, Total 70 GPIO
				This is an estimate and will likely change with time and the design.
