Electronic Controlled Electromechanical Switch:
	Trunks:
		0-2 POTS trunk lines
		DID support if possible, would need to parse Caller ID
		If not, programmable extension ringing
	Stations:
		0-8 Analog stations, each with programmable DNs.  
		DTMF and Pulse Support
		Properish full ring voltage, 90v RMS 20Hz Sine
	Tone Banks:
		2 tone banks, need at least one for each internal voice bus
		Produce call progress tones and decode DTMF
		Separate tone buses
	Internal Buses:
		2 internal voice paths, allowing for two simulaneous calls with any number of stations attached (multi-way calling)
		Can be used for internal calls or connected to a free analog trunk to place an outgoing call
		2 tone buses individually selectable.
	Electrical Parameters:
		Ring Generator:
			~1.2VA per 1 REN (13mA @ 90VRMS)
			Dividing active time can effectively triple REN capability of tranformer
			6 VA transformer: 5 REN no time division, effectively 15 REN with division
			Match amp wattage out approximately with transformer VA
		Station Cards:
			Gyrators to provide balaced line
			Ring / Voice Relay
			On-Station-Card Routing for modular design and cost savings
			Hook Detection:
				Optocoupler feeds schmitt trigger, uses software filtering to ignore ringing.
